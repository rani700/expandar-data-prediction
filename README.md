# expandar-data-prediction

## I have predicted Discharge Pressure(psig) column values using machine learning models named Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and deep learning models named Deep neural network,CNN and obtained rmse loss which are shown in below table.


| model name| RMSE value on Training set   | RMSE value on Training set |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Linear Regression   |  0.1136     |  0.1318       |
| Lasso Regression    | 0.1136      |0.1318         | 
| Deep Neural Network | 0.0851      |0.1545         |
| Deep Neural Network | 0.0410      |0.1592         |
   
   
All the details about the model are described in the jupyter notebook uploaded here https://github.com/rani700/expandar-data-prediction/blob/master/expandar-data-prediction.ipynb .Weight files are also uploaded here.
